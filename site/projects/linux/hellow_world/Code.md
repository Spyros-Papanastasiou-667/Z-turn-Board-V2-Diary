# Linux Hellow World!

## Goal: After PL(Blnking), hellow world from PS(Linux)

## Intermediate part: SDK: Providing necessary files to Vitis

In order for Vitis(application) to compile, the necessary **libraries** need to be installed. This can be done from **Petalinux**:

* `$ petalinux-build --sdk`
* `$ petalinux-package --sysroot --dir /path/to/empty/destination/sysroot`  
  (The latter, will populate sysroot with `/lib`)..

---

## Platform

Create a new platform with "linux" as the operating system. (Alternatively, expand an old platform with a "new domain").  
Also, no need for "boot artifacts":

![](images/platform.jpg)

* Link the petalinux `.bif` file, located either at petalinux's: `my_project/images/linux` directory (FIXME: created after config?).
* And the "pre-built image directory" (either `my_project/images/linux` or `tftp/dest`).

### FIXME: Prebuilt fsbl ?: No

* And build [the new platform\]..

---

## Application

Create a new application from templates(Linux Hellow World) (under `File/New Component/From Examples`).  
Set the `sysroot` directory, previously generated through `petalinux`(`--sdk`), to the (inner) `sysroot/sysroots/*-gnueabi` folder:

![](images/sysroot.jpg)

And build.. Note the generated `.elf` file.

## Intrermission: Info(Corrections)

As per the [tutorial]:

* `boot.scr` is the script that U-Boot reads during boot time to load the kernel and rootfs
* `image.ub` contains kernel image, device tree and rootfs

Thus, up until now, the `ext4` (where the `rootfs.tar.gz` was extracted) was not [actually being\] used ðŸ™Š!

---

## Troubleshooting

* [Newly created [Linux\]\] Domain [at previous [standalone\] platform\] [is\] not visible: Restarting [Vitis\] worked [for me\]..
